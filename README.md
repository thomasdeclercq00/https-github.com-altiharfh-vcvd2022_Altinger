vehicle components and vehicle dynamics WS2022/2023

# Working Principle of script
1. Run script (Python task.py)
2. Give input for mass, initial velocity, and inclination
3. Give input for road type and road conditions
(All the combinations work as from the presentation. This was not asked for in the assignment, but was added as a way to recap my Python skills, because I didn't use Python for multiple years.)
4. Multiple output values will be printed
5. 1 PDF file with the plots will be exported as plot.pdf

# Reason for lack of citations
All the principles used except one, where from personal scripts from previous years.
Because I didn't see the purpous in citing myself, I did not cite those parts.
